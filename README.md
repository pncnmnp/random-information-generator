# random-information-generator
**Generates a realistic random identity**

This was a project I created during December, 2017. It happens to be my first satisfactory project. 
I scrapped the data using BeautifulSoup and requests. I will be adding a procedure to scrape the information soon (my actual files which performed scrapping got deleted due to a careless mistake).

A linux command line utility : Random Information Generator (rig) was a major inspiration

## How to run the code
You can run the code normally by entering:
```
python3.5 random-information-generator.py
```

### Extra
This code will generate the following data randomly:

* Name (Both First and Last name) 
* Phone Number
* Landline number
* Service Provider (which matches with your landline number)
* Date of Birth
* Age
* Address

**Note: All the random information generated is confined to Mumbai Metropolitian Region to make it appear realistic**
